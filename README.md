# Network Traffic Analysis Lab

## Objective

The Network Traffic Analysis Lab follows the Hack The Box Academy Introduction to Network Traffic Analysis module and was designed to strengthen both conceptual and practical understanding of computer networking and packet analysis. The primary focus was to examine both pre-existing Packet Capture (PCAP) files and live packet capture data (using both TCPDump and Wireshark) and extract valuable information about current and past network traffic flows, especially as they relate to cybersecurity. This experience's purpose was to strenghten understanding of network security, attack patterns, and network forensics.

### Skills Learned

- Familiarity with network analysis tools like Wireshark and TCPDump
- Proficiency in analyzing and interpreting network traffic through Pack Captures.
- Ability to discover, isolate, and analyze suspicious network activity.
- Deepened knowledge of network protocols and security vulnerabilities.
- Development of critical thinking and problem-solving skills in cybersecurity.

### Tools Used

- Wireshark and TCPDump for intercepting and scrutinizing network traffic.
